        <h1 class="a-head">The Team</h1>
        <p class="team">Together we are a total of 19, when all of us come together we form a group, Reclye For Good. <br> Our team works for saving plastic wastage in our school and nearby destinations. We Are working with a few NGOs and Companies.</p>
        
        <h1 class="a-head2">The Problem</h1>
        <p class="problem"> Paper - Global paper consumption has increased by 400% over the last few years. New trees are being planted all over the world, but most plantations are monoculture (cultivating a single crop in a specific area), causing many environmental problems. To make matters worse, the pulp and paper industry is the fifth largest consumer of energy, accounting for four percent of all the world's energy use.
    
        
        <h1 class="a-head2">Our Plan</h1>
        <p class="solution">We know that we can not reduce paper wastage globally but we can reduce the wastage of paper at our end, and motivate others to do so by spreading awareness. To reduce paper  from our end we are planning to - 
            Connect With NGOs, Place Paper collection boxes through-out our school, Spread awareness in personal societies, Make new books out of old paper, Recycling Paper, Book Drive (Connecting With Charities) etc.
